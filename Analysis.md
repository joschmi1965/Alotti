Valuable features
- learning by spaced repitition
- learn on your mobile device and manage your data on your computer at home in  a more comfortable way
- large platform to exchange learning material eg. videos, text, possibility to ask experts (and a lot for free)
- easy navigation to an analysis board in positions
- add your own variations to the learning material to extend for your personal needs, or even contribute yourself
- easy possibility to ask question to experts during the learning process
- learning process customizable, esp. learn key positions, schedule of spaced repetition, number of repetions while learning
- courses grouped by ELO
- very mature software and learning platform, a lot of people working for it and who contribute, probably more features to come

Features in question from my perspective 
- gamification: the only real motivation is to see progress towards learning 100% of eg. an opening repertoire, or better results in own games, or better analysis results eg. from Lichess™ studies of own games
- MoveTrainer checks your knowledge: everybody can evaluate him/herself

Features missing compared to Alotti© based on Anki™ (maybe it's there but I missed it)
- bundle of moves as learning material: tactics and repositioning of pieces are best learned in a bundled way and all at once (ok, tactics can be learned elsewhere eg. in Lichess™), especially learning an opening repertoire includes here and there tactical shots
- decide on when to repeat: in Anki™ out of the box you can decide while learning which card was easily memorized, or not, and dependent on this the schedule to repeat the card differs - and this makes a lot of sense
- change focus: imagine you invested a lot in your learning material and over time you realize that your progress fades out, so a nice feature is that you can classify your material in important vs. less important, and focus on the important material from now on without removing the less important data (in this way it's saved for future activities)
- mark cards for further analysis: while learning chess on my Mobile AnkiDroid I usually mark my cards where I have doubts about the quality, so that later at the weekend I review all cards marked for to improve my material
- problematic conflicts: by combining learning material you will be faced with conflicts, ie. in the same position you have to give different answers, esp. if your material is of large size, so there should be a tip by your tool to help out of this
- position evaluation: an objective evaluation of positions checks the quality of the learning material, so that you are ensured about its quality (if not you simply classify it as problematic, see above)
- statistics about repetition: especially if there exists a position which is hard to learn - german "Lernbremse" - which has to be tackled to get better progress in learning
- own your data: probably you might suffer from the fact that the data you invest in is stored anywhere on the globe and you heavily depend on it in worst case the whole lifetime (ok, Alotti© depends on the Anki™ platform)
