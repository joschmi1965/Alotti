## Getting started

### Preparation
- Manually create cards in AnkiBot.
- Install AnkiBot, AnkiDroid and create account on AnkiWeb.

### First dataset
- Create 1st small set of PGN data, import in AnkiBot, Sync with AnkiDroid and run a learning session.
- Extend the PGN data to create a 1st sub tree to start to build up your opening repertoire with the help of Lichess™ opening library or books.
- While learning mark card, sync with Ankibot, review position by the help of Lichess™ analysis board.
Change in PGN dataset, import to AnkiBot, review the change and unmark the card.
- Backp your PGN dataset.


## Installation and accounts

### Anki on Windows and on Android™ mobiles
- AnkibBot on Windows™
- AnkiDroid on Android™ mobiles
- Account in AnkiWeb

### Anki™ on macOS™ and on iOS™ mobiles
TODO


## Intermediate

### Ease to manage your data
- Install Microsoft VS Code™ on Windows™ and create workspace for your data.
- Create Github account, create a private repository and backup your source data to the cloud.

### Care about data quality
- Fix issues in PGN dataset (PGN notation, use of specific characters).
- Fix different answers in the same position.
- Consider evaluation of positions with Lichess™ cloud DB.
- Add comments to PGN dataset.
- Remove superfluous cards from Anki dataset.
- Fix issues with cards in the wrong batch in Anki dataset.
- Eliminate duplicates.
- Introduce several systems to organize your learning material better.
- Introduce variants for each system to organize your learning material even better.


## Professional

### Leverage from extra features
- Follow link to Lichess™ analysis board in positions and play against the remote chess engine.
- Add evaluation of positions out of Lichess™ cloud DB's opening repertoire by local chess engine.
- Bundle a set of moves for a card to cover tactics or repositioning of pieces.
- Bundle a set of moves for a card based on a distinct position indicated by a FEN to cover middle- or endgames.
- Change pure PGN data to bundles of moves.
- Reduce your learning material by different annotations.
- Use file filter to generate from parts of your FEN and PGN dataset.
- Use Github to collaborate with others to join forces to build up FEN and PGN datasets.
- Analyse games by Lichess™ studies and derive learning material from this.
- Create support, feature and bug fix requests for this project.
